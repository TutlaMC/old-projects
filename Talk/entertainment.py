And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon. So the man and his wife decided to kill the bird.However, upon cutting the goose open, they were shocked to find that its innards were like that of any other goose!"

He looked back at the tortoise and cried out, How do you expect to win this race when you are walking along at your slow, slow pace?are stretched himself out alongside the road and fell asleep, thinking, There is plenty of time to relax.The Tortoise walked and walked, never ever stopping until he came to the finish line.The animals who were watching cheered so loudly for Tortoise that they woke up the Hare. The Hare stretched, yawned and began to run again, but it was too late. Tortoise had already crossed the finish line."
